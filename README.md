The RAW Stack
========

Why the RAW stack? Well it is kind of the equivalent of the MEAN stack. Not that there is anything wrong with the MEAN stack, quite the opposite, but being a .NET developer I really like to keep using .NET where it's strengths lie and where it is suitable. On the server C# with its fast async capabilities is still quite awesome.

A running demo can be found [here](http://rawstack.azurewebsites.net/).

## [RavenDB](http://ravendb.net/) ##
RavenDB is a transactional, open-source Document Database written in .NET, and offering a flexible data model designed to address requirements coming from real-world systems. RavenDB allows you to build high-performance, low-latency applications quickly and efficiently.

## [AngularJS](http://angularjs.org/) ##
HTML is great for declaring static documents, but it falters when we try to use it for declaring dynamic views in web-applications. AngularJS lets you extend HTML vocabulary for your application. The resulting environment is extraordinarily expressive, readable, and quick to develop.

## [ASP.NET WebAPI](http://www.asp.net/web-api) ##
ASP.NET Web API is a framework that makes it easy to build HTTP services that reach a broad range of clients, including browsers and mobile devices. ASP.NET Web API is an ideal platform for building RESTful applications on the .NET Framework.
